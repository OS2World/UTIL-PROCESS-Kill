This is a little utility I wrote to kill a process by specifying it's
PID rather than by name as killem does, and while the new version of
killem does allow the specification of a PID you must first convert it
decimal. This version of kill lets you input the HEX PID as given in
the output of the OS/2 command PSTAT. I've also included the source
code so that anyone can modify it.

kill was written using the GCC port of the GNU C compiler for
OS/2 2.0.
